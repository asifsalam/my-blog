Understanding “tokens” and tokenization in large language models | by Michael Humor | Medium,Michael Humor,"January 3, 2024 3:07 PM",,,"In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), the term “token” refers to a chunk of text that the model reads or generates. A token is typically not a word; it could be a smaller unit, like a character or a part of a word, or a larger one like a whole phrase. In  the GPT architecture, a sequence of tokens serves as the input and/or output during both training and inference (the stage where the model generates text based on a given prompt).",,https://medium.com/@michaelhumor/understanding-tokens-and-tokenization-in-large-language-models-1058cd24b944,2023/09/10,2023-09-10,,"ai, explainer, introductory, llm, post, technique",,2024-01-03,,2023-09-10,,

Deep Learning: A Critical Appraisal,Gary Marcus,"August 7, 2022 11:22 AM",2022-08-07,2022/08/07,"Although deep learning has historical roots going back decades, neither the term ""deep learning"" nor the approach was popular just over five years ago, when the field was reignited by papers such as Krizhevsky, Sutskever and Hinton's now classic (2012) deep network model of Imagenet. What has the field discovered in the five subsequent years? Against a background of considerable progress in areas such as speech recognition, image recognition, and game playing, and considerable enthusiasm in the popular press, I present ten concerns for deep learning, and suggest that deep learning must be supplemented by other techniques if we are to reach artificial general intelligence.",https://static.arxiv.org/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/cu/cornell-reduced-white-SMALL.svg,https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00631,,,,,,2022-08-07,,,,
